## About

I am a Master's student in the [School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/). I work with [Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/) as a member of [KIXLAB](https://www.kixlab.org/). I'm interested in building interactive systems to support diverse collaborative tasks (from travel planning to UI design). In particular, I aim to introduce various types of technological support (e.g., AI, visualizations, multi-modal input) to enhance communication within collaboration teams.
